# LibraryManagementSystem

The Library Management System is a program for users to manage patrons through normal crud operations.

Requirements for this project where
--Store the Patrons as objects in memory in some sort of data structure
--Give the users a menu to add, remove, display all, load from file
--Program needed to successfully handle file imports of data from a location on the users computer
--Various validations of data were required

This project demostrates my ability to write a basic command line interface program that performs crud operations. It also demonstrates creating and using objects, lists and abstraction.
